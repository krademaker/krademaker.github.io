I'm an incoming PhD student with Tim Coorens at the European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge (UK), using computational tools to analyse mutations in single-cell and spatial data to uncover human development and cancer origins. I obtained BSc and MSc degrees in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology back in the Netherlands (Nijmegen, then Amsterdam), completed my MSc thesis in Oliver Stegle's group in Heidelberg in joint supervision with Omer Bayraktar, and subsequently transitioned to a bioinformatician position in his group as the Wellcome Sanger Insititute in Cambridge. Here, I analysed large and novel spatial transcriptomics datasets such as Visium (HD) and Xenium to study the origins of neurodevelopmental conditions.
