I'm an incoming PhD student with Tim Coorens at the European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge (UK), using computational tools to analyse mutations in single-cell and spatial data to uncover human development and cancer origins. I completed a BSc (Nijmegen) and MSc (Amsterdam) in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology back in the Netherlands, then conducted my MSc thesis in Oliver Stegle's group at the DKFZ in Heidelberg in collaboration with Omer Bayraktar, and subsequently transitioned a bioinformatician role in his group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge. Here, I analysed large and novel spatial transcriptomics datasets - Visium (HD), Xenium - to study origins of neurodevelopmental conditions.
